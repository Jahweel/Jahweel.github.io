Welcome to my blog everyone,

I am currently a Student at the University of Connecticut with an interest in Data with programming mixed in.

This blog is personal for me and will be used to track my progress as I countinue to learn.

My main goal is just to keep growing my skills and I want this blog to represent that as I countinue this journey.
